# Prosperous Assistant
A windowsforms application intended to serve as a companion tool for the game Prosperous Universe. It uses the FIO REST API as a source of data, with language bindings from my other project, FIOSharp.

The tool is currently in it's early stages, but the ultimate aim is for it to be able to completely replace all of the spreadsheets that are needed to play the game effectively. Which is to say, replace all of my spreadsheets that I use to play the game
